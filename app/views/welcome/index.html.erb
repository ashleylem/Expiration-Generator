                <p class="px-40 mx-24">The way expiration dates are currently printed on food packaging make it incredibly dificult to locate
            and tend to easily smudge. An easy solution to this problem is printing a qr-code that when scanned will tell you the expiration date. No more guesswork on whether the number printed is a 5 or a 3, 
            or other problems that come with the traditional way of printing expiration dates.  </p>

            <h2>How it Works</h2>
            <div>
            <ul>
            <li>Create a new user. Make sure to sign up with your company's name because it will show on every page your qr code links to</li>
            <li>Once you're logged, in add your company's logo</li>
            <li>Start creating your QR Codes! All you need to add is your product name and expiration date and we'll do the rest</li>
            <li>Once you've created your first QR code you'll see it on your profile page with the options to view the generated page, edit the information inputed and download the image</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Each QR code will link to a page that displays your company name, logo, and of course the expiration date you entered. </p>
